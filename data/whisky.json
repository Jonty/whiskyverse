There was also a wholesome earthy oakiness (potting table in a greenhouse?), very sweet oranges, soft leather and tobacco. The neat taste had lots of lemon bitterness moving into intense orange barley sugar sweetness, finishing with cr\u00e8me caramel pots, grapefruit and light vanilla. With water we entered a florist\u2019s in summer, and were served lemon syrup cocktails. There was an intriguing \u201cfizzy buzz\u201d about it (Cremola foam), eucalyptus oil and the sweetness of orange with the sour edge of fresh lime.",

The initial taste found travel sweets, menthol cigarettes, burnt sticks, spicy fennel seed sausages and smoked mussels \u2013 served by a swimming pool or in a hospital emergency room.

Another cocktail comparison was a New Orleans Fizz containing gin, lemon and lime juice, orange flower water, sugar, cream, egg white and soda water. The mouthfeel followed along the same theme; fizzy, bubbly, sparkling pineapple flavoured soda water and dried fruits in a cream sauce. With water a classic vanilla slice, mango ice cream and chocolate covered marshmallows whilst the taste was that of a baked Alaska with chocolate ice cream.",

The taste neat is still fruity but with a drying, slightly chalky mouth-feel. Pear biscuits, cooked pineapples, grapefruits - all with a dusting of icing sugar. With water, crystallized fruits in Tutti Frutti ice cream, lavender and lily of the valley, reminding some of a lady\u2019s powder compact. The taste is now very floral with an elegant perfume scent; a chic and sophisticated example from this distillery 3 miles south of Elgin still using worm tubs to cool the distilled vapours.",

        "description": "This was a full Scottish Breakfast served in a leather armchair in front of a peat fire with aromas of fried eggs and bacon, grilled tomato, tatties, bangers, baked beans, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and black pudding. Wait until you try it. A sweet, smoky and savoury sensation! It has it all, everything you ever wanted in the right amount and in the right balance \u2013 just throw away the cork. If you want to add water; we were handed a vihta \u2013 a bunch of fresh birch branches to get whipped with in a Finnish sauna and the taste was bittersweet chocolate, mouth-watering and to die for.",

An intense icy fresh mouth-feel like a \u2018Whisky Smash\u2019 with a subtle sweet peat smoke infusion. Water added an intriguing mixture of sweet, salty, herbal and phenolic aromas; cloves, rosemary, burnt brown sugar, mint, and seaweed. The taste was an iceberg wedge salad with red peppers, black olives and roasted pine nuts with an olive oil dressing.",

Lightly fruity, \u2018the makings of a mohito\u2019, rosewater, traces of plastic raincoat, then macaroon bars in spades. Unreduced, the taste is initially sharp (over infused lemon tea), though pleasant, with some white pepper and a coconut/whin flower finish. It benefits from a dash of water, raising scented candles, \u2018Fuzzy Peach\u2019 soap from Bodyshop, then acid drops and Fry\u2019s Chocolate Cream fondant, before reverting to macaroon bars. A soft texture, and a dusty, sweet, warming taste; mouth-cooling (\u2018clove-flavoured Edinburgh rock\u2019), with dessicated coconut in the aftertaste.",

The taste was very much along the same lines; plum tarts with honey and black pepper as well as apple and sour cherry pie. With water, turning a touch sweeter; butter cakes with honeyed pears and waffles with hot strawberry jam and we all could not resist the temptation of having a maple-sweetened chocolate cupcake topped with a honey cream cheese frosting.",
